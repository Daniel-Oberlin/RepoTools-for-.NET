REPOTOOL - Repository Tool for Data Validation

This tool maintains a manifest of files in a repository along with their hash
values and last modified dates.  In this way, the data integrity of the
repository can be validated conveniently.  The manifest is stored in a file at
the top level directory of the repository.


SYNTAX:

rt command [option] ...


COMMANDS:

    help
        Show this description of commands and options.

    create
        Create an empty repository manifest in the current directory.

    status
        Check every file in the manifest based on file length and last modified
        date.  Check the hash values of modified files.  Report new files,
        missing files, and any differences.

    validate
        Check every file in the manifest against its hash value.  Report new
        files, missing files, and any differences.

    update
        Bring the manifest up to date with the current state of the repository.
        By default, only the file length and last modified dates are checked.
        New hashes will be computed for any changes detected.  The update will
        account for new files, removed files, and changed files.  A new copy of
        the manifest file will be written by this command.

    edit
        Make changes to the manifest settings without scanning files.  A new
        copy of the manifest file will be written by this command.

    groom
        Remove any files that are not listed in the manifest(!)

    info
        Show manifest information.

    clear
        Clear the manifest.  Remove all file entries.


OPTIONS:

    -silent
        Don't output anything.  Exit code may still be checked by a script.

    -detail
        List the actual files that are different - not just the counts.

    -all
        Process ignored files as well.  For -detail and groom.

    -showProgress
        List each file as it is being scanned.

    -ignoreDate
        Don't count a date change alone as being a significant difference
        between the manifest and the repository.  Don't return an error exit
        code for this difference alone.  Useful for status and validate
        commands.

    -ignoreNew
        Don't count the presence of new files alone as being a significant
        difference between the manifest and the repository.  Don't return an
        error exit code for this difference alone.  Useful for status and
        validate commands.

    -force
        Don't stop to ask for anything - deleting files, etc.

    -time
        Measure and report the time of the operation.

    -name repositoryName
        Specify the name of the repository in the manifest.

    -description repositoryDescription
        Specify a description of the repository in the manifest.

    -backDate
        For files whose last modified dates have been changed but are otherwise
        identical, this option will set the dates back to their values which
        were stored in the manifest.

    -trackMoves
        Try to identify files that have been renamed or moved based on their
        hash values.

    -trackDuplicates
        Try to identify duplicate files based on their hash values.

    -ignore ignoreExpression
        Add a regular expression which matches filename paths which should be
        ignored by the manifest.

    -dontIgnore ignoreExpression
        Remove a regular expression which was added with -ignore.

    -ignoreDefault
        Replace the list of ignored filename expressions with the default list.
        The default list is obtained from the prototype manifest if it is
        available.

    -hashMethod method
        Specify the default hash method used by the manifest: MD5 or SHA256
		
    -newHash
        Recompute all hash values using the default hash method.  Useful if
        the default hash method has changed and you want all files to be using
        the default hash method.  This is not required because each file has
        its own hash method which was inherited from the default when it was
        last computed.  This is expensive because the hash is checked twice -
        first with the original method to check the status, and second with
        the new method to change the hash.

    -reHash
        Recompute all hash values during an update.  Useful if a file has
        changed somehow but you don't care.  Maybe you've lost the original
        file and you dont' want to be bothered with error messages any more.

    -manifestFile
        Path to the manifest file.  Defaults to ".manifestPrototype" in the
        current working directory.

    -recursive
        Start in working directory and recursively search for and handle any
        manifests in lower subdirectories.

    -noTouch
        After a validation, do not write to the manifest in order to update
        the date of validation.
